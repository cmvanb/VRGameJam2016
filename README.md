# VR Game Jam 2016

This is a simple technical demo made in ~36 hours for a game jam I participated in. I worked with my friend Daan Boon to build a VR experience inspired by the Tron movies. It's not quite a game since we didn't get to implement many game mechanics, but the gist of it is you get to ride a lightcycle at blistering speeds through a computer world. You can see some gameplay here:
