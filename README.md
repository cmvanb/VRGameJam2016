# VR Game Jam 2016

This is a VR experience made in ~36 hours for a game jam I participated in. I worked with my friend Daan Boon to build a Tron inspired experience in which you ride a lightcycle (futuristic motorcycle) at blistering speeds through a computer world. It's more of a technical demo than a game since we didn't get to implement many game features, but it was a hit at the jam and we took first place in the competition!

Built with an Oculus 2 SDK and LeapMotion input device in Unity3D.

You can see some gameplay here:
